# Inspiration
Call of Duty, Valorant, Counter-Strike, Battlefield

# What it does
A fast-paced 1v1 top-down shooter where players duel until one reaches 30 eliminations.

# How we built it
We built the game using **Roblox Studio** as our game engine. We used free models as a base and scripted the **gun system**, **game mechanics**, **camera**, and **UI** ourselves. Our custom scripting controls the flow of the match, ensuring smooth **gunplay**, **player interactions**, and **score tracking** for an engaging 1v1 experience.

# Challenges we ran into
Making a game with **Roblox Studio** from scratch.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made a game that doesn't look like a regular, cubic **Roblox** game.

# What we learned
We learned that with some imagination and ambition, we can do everything we want.

# What's next for ALIVE
Add more **weapons**, **maps**, **game modes**, and more!

# Built With
- **Lua**
- **Roblox Studio**
